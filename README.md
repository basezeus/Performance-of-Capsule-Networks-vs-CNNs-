# Performance-of-Capsule-Networks-vs-CNNs-
Geoffrey Hinton , one of the pioneers of Deep Learning has come up with a new architecture for computer Vision called as Capsule Networks which are based on the fundamental units called Capsules.This latest architecture possesses the quality of EQUIVARIANCE which is not present in CNNs and utilises this to its benefit. This ground-breaking architecture claims to outperform the traditional CNN based architectures on many standard datasets . This hypothesis is tested by implementing the original Capsule Network as given by Hinton along with a CNN architecture and compare their results on the two standard datasets of MNIST and CIFAR10.
